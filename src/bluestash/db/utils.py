Utility Functions for File System Scanning and Database Operations

This module provides utility functions for scanning the file system,
calculating file hashes, and storing directory and file information in the database.
It includes functions for recursive directory traversal, file content hashing,
and database operations.

The module uses asyncio for concurrent operations to improve performance
when scanning large directory structures.
